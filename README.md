This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- Node and NPM installed (latest, no specific version requirement)

## Configuration and library dependencies

- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in a Strava API key (this will be changed in production deploy, secret keys should not be in .env)
- Run `npm install`

## Available Build Scripts

The standard set of the build scripts for create-react-app. In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Starts the application in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will refresh on code edits and lint warnings will be displayed in the console.

### `npm run-script test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
